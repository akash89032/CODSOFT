# Movie Rating Prediction Project

## Overview

The Movie Rating Prediction Project is an in-depth exploration of machine learning applied to the domain of movie ratings. It aims to predict movie ratings based on user demographics and movie features, ultimately enabling personalized movie recommendations. This project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and comprehensive performance evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project directory is meticulously organized to streamline every aspect:

- `data`: Contains the dataset files, including `movies.dat`, `users.dat`, and `ratings.dat`.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration and analysis, each covering a distinct phase of the project.
- `code`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation, ensuring modularity and reusability.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Dataset

Our project hinges on the MovieLens dataset, a rich source of movie-related information:

- `movies.dat`: This file captures essential movie details such as MovieID, Title, and Genres.
- `users.dat`: Includes user demographics, with fields like UserID, Gender, Age, Occupation, and zip-code.
- `ratings.dat`: Contains the heart of the project, user ratings for movies, revealing UserID, MovieID, Rating, and Timestamp.

## Data Preprocessing

The journey commences with thorough data preprocessing:

- Handling missing values: We addressed missing data, ensuring it doesn't skew our analyses.
- Data type conversions: Ensured consistent data types for precise modeling.
- Merging datasets: We merged data from various sources to create a unified dataset for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Understanding the data is pivotal. Our EDA efforts include:

- Rating distributions: Analyzing how users rate movies, revealing trends.
- User demographics: Exploring user profiles based on age, gender, and occupation.
- Genre popularity: Determining the most popular movie genres among users.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering breathes life into our models:

- 'User_Avg_Rating': We introduced this feature to capture each user's average rating tendencies.
- Genre-based features: Binary features for each genre enable genre-specific predictions.

## Model Selection

Our journey into modeling starts with selecting the right algorithm:

- Primary model: We opted for a Random Forest Regressor, well-suited for complex regression tasks.

## Model Performance Evaluation

-"Model performance in this project is evaluated using accuracy, a common metric for classification tasks. In the context of this project, accuracy measures how well the model predicts user movie ratings in terms of correctly classifying them into rating categories. A higher accuracy score indicates that the model is better at assigning the correct rating labels to movies based on user demographics and features. The goal is to maximize accuracy to enhance the precision of movie recommendations

## Data Visualization

We leveraged data visualization techniques to gain deeper insights into our dataset:

- Rating distribution histograms: Visualizing how users rated movies, helping us identify common rating trends.
- Genre preference bar charts: Highlighting the most preferred movie genres among users.

## Future Improvements

We continue to refine our approach:

- Future directions: Explore more feature engineering techniques, alternative regression algorithms, and advanced hyperparameter tuning.
- Enhancing accuracy: Aiming to provide even more accurate movie recommendations.
