# Iris Flower Classification

## Introduction

The Iris Flower Classification project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset widely used for introductory classification tasks.

### Dataset Description

The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Code Overview

The project code is written in Python and utilizes popular libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

### Code Structure

The project code can be broken down into the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: The dataset (iris.csv) is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. Initial data exploration includes checking for missing values, data types, and generating summary statistics.

2. **Data Visualization**: Various data visualizations, including histograms, density plots, box plots, and violin plots, are used to gain insights into the dataset's distribution and relationships between features.

3. **Correlation Analysis**: A correlation matrix and a heatmap are created to explore the relationships between different features in the dataset.

4. **Machine Learning Model Building**: The project explores several machine learning algorithms for classification, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Model performance is assessed using accuracy scores and confusion matrices. Classification reports are also generated to provide detailed performance metrics.

6. **User Input and Prediction**: The code allows users to input sepal and petal measurements, and the trained k-NN classifier predicts the species of the Iris flower based on these inputs.

### Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the Python script.
